### Database Config Setup
Create new database (let's say i'm going to use postgresql and my database name is **pharmly**).
so in my **.env** file will set below parameters.
```
DB_HOST=localhost                   # database connection host
DB_USER=root                        # database username
DB_PASS=password                    # database password
DB_NAME=pharmly                     # database name
DB_DIALECT=postgres                 # database dialect
DB_PORT=3306                        # database port
```
some other inportant parameters/keys in **.env** file
```
APP_HOST=localhost      # application host name
APP_PORT=3000           # application port
SECRET=secret           # secret key for encrypt/decrypt JWT token
```

### Migration and Seeders run
After creating database and updating .env file run below commands
```
> node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
> node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all

Migration will create table users and seed some default users

Seeders will create one new client entry in application and 2 users entry one admin and one normal user.

`npm start` to run your project
